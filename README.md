With the help of reverse engineering the APK file, I found the following bugs in the program:

1. The application is trying to access an incorrect link. Therefore it is necessary to correct the URL in the Srtings.xml file

2. In the Activity_Game class, in the finishGame() function, there was Toast.duration in the code = 1, which is incorrect, so I changed it to Toast.LENGTH_LONG

3. In the AndroidManifest file it is required to add 2 lines of code. The first to allow access to the Internet and the second to declare Activity_Game.

Game Instructions:
1. You entered an ID number that will be the input of the game.
2. Each arrow among the arrows shown is a digit for modulo 4. That is, the digits 0-3. To win the game it is necessary to press the arrow corresponding to the digit which is modulo 4 corresponding to the digit from the ID number entered. Otherwise, you will be disqualified.

Representing the digits as follows:
Up arrow-2
Right arrow-1
Left arrow-0
Down arrow-3

for example:
Input: 222222222
Click on the top arrow 9 times.
Output: You survived in Florida.
